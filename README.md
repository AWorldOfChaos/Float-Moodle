# Float-Moodle
Welcome to our Project for the CS251: Software Systems Lab course in the Fall Semester 2021 at IIT Bombay.  

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project was to create a web application which can be used for online learning and for hosting such courses.
Moodle is a Learning Platform or course management system(CMS). Our goal was to create a similar such application with our own take on it :)  
And hence, **F**or **L**ack **O**f **A**nother **T**erm, we called it Float Moodle  

## Basic Structure
Like Moodle, our application involves users who can sign up and must login to authenticate their sessions. The basic building blocks of Float-Moodle are the 
courses which also host most of the interactions between users.

### Course Structure
Courses have a head instructor, instructors and/or Teaching Assistants and students. Courses allow for posting of assignments to which students can make submissions.
Instructors can grade these assignments and view the overall performance of the class while students can view an analysis of their own performance.

### Forums
There are 2 major forums allowing for discussions.
- The 'Messages' section allows students to communicate directly with one another.
- The 'Forum' present in each course allows for instructors and students alike to have fruitful discussions on a platform visible albeit restricted to students enrolled in that course


## Technical Summary
We used the Django framework to build our application. We, also, have extensively used HTML, css and javascript.
All the required dependencies are captured by the requirements.txt file. Note that you will need a python interpreter to execute the code.
