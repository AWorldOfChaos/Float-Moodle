I am really excited to apply for the Teaching Assistant position at for PH107. I have a passion for sharing knowledge and inspiring students, and I am thrilled at the opportunity to make a positive impact on the students undertaking this course. I understand the importance of creating a challenging, fun, and safe environment for students. I take pride in getting to know students on a personal level to better understand their needs, and I enjoy taking an active role in helping them.
Apart from my passion to interact with students, I liked the course content very much when I took the course in my first year. I will also get to revise all the concepts.
